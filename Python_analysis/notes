Notes for analysis:
* Some edge cases:
- When window for alignment is out of range (falls out of trial), what to do?
    - Option: ignore that trial
    - Option 2: Take up to whatever is allowed, and pad with zeros (can introduce artefacts..)
    - Option 3: Fill whole trial with nan (will do this)
    - Option 4: Like option 2, but pad with nan's
